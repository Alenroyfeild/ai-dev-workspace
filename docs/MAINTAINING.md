# Feedback, issues and releases

## The loop

Users normally never type these: the assistant reads `ws notices` (MCP `notices`) at session start and offers the next step, and offers `feedback add` when the user hits friction. The commands below are what it runs on the user's yes.


```text
user        ws feedback add "..." --kind bug|idea|friction|praise     (stays local, redacted)
user        ws feedback submit N            preview: nothing leaves the machine
user        ws feedback submit N --yes      creates a GitHub issue (gh CLI) or prints a prefilled issue URL
            ws feedback link N <url>        only needed after the URL route
maintainer  triage the issue → fix in a PR with "Fixes #N" → add a CHANGELOG line
maintainer  release (below)
user        ws doctor / ws update --check   shows the new version and its notes
user        ws update                       fast-forwards the kit clone (refuses if it has local changes)
user        ws feedback sync                ticks the local item when its issue is closed
```

Feedback is redacted before it is shown or sent, and `submit` always previews first: company names or details in feedback text should be removed by the user before `--yes`.

## Triage labels

`feedback` (all user reports) plus the kind: `bug`, `idea`, `friction`, `praise`. Add `pack:<name>` when a report is about one pack, and `good first issue` for small ones. Close an issue only by a merged fix or a reasoned "won't do" comment, so `ws feedback sync` reflects real outcomes.

## Versions

Semantic versioning in `kit.json`:
- patch `0.1.1` – fixes, docs, pack content
- minor `0.2.0` – new commands, packs or MCP tools (backward compatible)
- major `1.0.0` – breaking changes to `workspace.json`, task format or commands; ship a migration in `ws/upgrade.py` keyed on `schema_version`

## Cutting a release

1. Move the `CHANGELOG.md` entries under a new `## <version> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` heading. Write it for users: first line is a one-sentence summary (the update notice shows it), then Improved, Fixed, Measured and Known limits, each line saying what changes for the user. Use absolute links; relative ones break on the release page.
2. Set the same version in `kit.json`.
3. Commit, then `git tag v<version> && git push --tags`. Do not create the GitHub Release by hand.
4. `.github/workflows/release.yml` checks the tag matches `kit.json`, runs the tests and publishes the GitHub Release as Latest with that CHANGELOG section plus upgrade steps. Users see the summary on their next `ws doctor` / `ws update --check` (checked at most once a day).

## Repository setting

`repo` in `kit.json` is the `owner/name` that update checks and issue submission use; the `WS_REPO` environment variable overrides it. If it still starts with `OWNER/`, those commands say no GitHub repo is set.
